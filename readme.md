Viva CMS
================================

The Viva CMS has been written from scratch using Lua and Luvit and is available on GitHub under an MiT license. The reason I went with a custom CMS is based on the following reasons:

   * ► Security: Viva CMS requires no logins, no database, no administration panel and, as such, stores no user data, passwords and in no way exposes the visitors (you) to any threats to their identities. There are only two ways to compromise it (as far as I know): Eighter my VPS credidentials get exposed and someone gets access to the server or a malicious ad passes through the ad providers service. 

   * ► Openness: The Source Code for the CMS can easily be obtained from Github and anyone is free to modify, alter, enhance and use it free of charge. 

   * ► Love for Lua: I'm a programmer and game designer and I have used Lua extensively since I entered the game development industry. Nowadays I work in home automation and I use Lua at work to write plugins that act as a bridge between third party devices (such as HVACS, Lights, Entertainment systems, etc) and my employers HuB. I wanted to design a CMS that other Lua users can pick up and extend to their hearts content. 

   * ► Ability to enhance and maintain it from a Chromebook: After leaving the game development industry I wanted to decouple myself from the regular desktop and instead embrace mobility. As such I bought a Chromebook and looked forward to starting a project that I could work on using my new tool. With no databases, frameworks and desktop oriented tools (such as desktop game engines and editors) a website seemed like the best contender.
